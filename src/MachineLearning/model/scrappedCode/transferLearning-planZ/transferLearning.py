"""
1 Student teams need to create their project from scratch. Forking already-working solution repositories or any other sources entirely is not permitted.
2 Referring to and blatantly copying someone else’s code is different. Referring means understanding and re-implementing the codes, instead of only copy-and-pasting out of the source without knowing what is in it - because even the most copy-pasted thing from StackOverflow has a bug.
3 You may use or reuse any existing framework, programming language, techniques, tools, or even your own code.
4 One suggestion is to try re-implement a solution with your own language. It is okay to rewrite or port software from another source.
5 For Machine Learning models: you’re free to use part of the learning mechanism or try to transfer learning from existing models, as long as it’s not just plugging already working models onto your project.
